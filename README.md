# Flappy-Bird

Computer Organization Course Final Project

•	A game to control a bird continuously moves to the right, passing through sets of pipes. 

•	Bird flaps up briefly each time the player tap SPACE key; if SPACE is not taped, bird drops down due to gravity. 

•	Pipes are created randomly and scroll continuously to the left. The pipes have always the same distance between them and the running track does not stop. 

•	If the bird hits the pipes, player loses.

•	Each pair of pipes that bird navigates between earns the player a single point, which displayed in HEX.
